localization
============

Repo for collaborative creation of localized documentation.

Each language will have it's own top level directory, with sub directories for each library, versions, and resource type. For example /ja/SoundJS/0.4.0/docs or  /fr/EaselJS/0.6.0/tutorials.

Add an issue if you'd like to translate documentation or other materials to a new language. Submit a pull request to contribute to an existing translation request.
